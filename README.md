# DDJ 400 Skin Template

A template that is ready for printing and cutting because I didn't want to pay a random company to make one for me, so I made my own.
Expect some slightly miss aligned things as this been done by a person who never touched illustrator before in their life. but its negligible do dont worry (unless you have extreme ocd)
I will not be able to offer support because I am not active on this platform. Unfortunately, you will have to figure things out on your own.
Have fun creating your own deck skins!

p.s. i will not be making any other DDJ skin templates as this project is for my own personal use.

New version out now! Latest version was done from scratch due to many missaligned knobs and the file being a lazy pile of trash to begin with.
Now with cutter ready paths! Edit the file and fit your image of choice instead of the one inside labeled "image" and send it to the press techs. Or print and cut yourself if you have those tools!
