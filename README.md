# DDJ 400 Skin Template

A template that is ready for printing and cutting because I didn't want to pay a random company to make one for me, so I made my own.
Some of the knob cutouts are little off, but that doesn't matter since the knobs will cover them anyway.
I will provide Illustrator files for cutting later, however you can easily create them yourself. 
I'll edit it later with some size suggestions so the printing guys can figure it out.
I will not be able to offer support because I am not active on this platform. Unfortunately, you will have to figure things out on your own.
Have fun creating your own deck!

p.s. i will not be making any other DDJ skin templates as this project is for my own personal use.

Link to the file cause github wont allow me to upload it (its over 25mb)
